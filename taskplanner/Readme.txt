#taskplanner
How to compile my program (ie.  javac *.java)
javac *.java

Which  file includes the main-method
OrganizeMyTasks.java

Any assumptions you have made when implementing the assignment
Project does not contain a large amount of data.

Any peculiarities about your implementation
1. OrganizeMyTask just call the PlanMyTask class so I can make this project huger if I want to.
2. A lot of comments as I can present this code in a five-ten minutes presentation.
3. The big-oh at the methods is not correct, as the loop threats its content as a "white-box"

The status of your delivery (what works and what does not)
Everything works.

Ideas for what can be improved:
1.  Run the project based on each task latest time.
2.  Run the project based on how much manpower is needed.
3.  Make it possible for the user to create a file when running the program.
4.  Make it possible for the user to print out the project plan. 
5.  Make it possible to run projects with large data.
6.  Make it possible for the user to save the data.

Give credit if your code is heavily in infuenced by some source (ie.  teachingmaterial)
The algorithms Quicksort, depth first three and topological sort is influenced by Mark Allen Weiss: Data Structures and Algorithm Analysis in Java, ISBN: 0-321-37319-7.
